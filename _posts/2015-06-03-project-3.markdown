description: The Voter Registration Tool was developed and launched by my Tech Development Team during the 2012 Presidential Election. I was the Nevada State Data Director on President Barack Obama's Re-election Campaign and I managed all in state web application development efforts. We used the Voter Registration Tool to register over 90,000 voters. The responsively designed web app provides a simple data entry system which integrates hard data with powerful reporting and meaningful analytics. Leadership, Staff, and Volunteers alike were able to track and analyze our voter registration program using data points such as location, time, date, canvasser, and registrant data in real time. This empowered our team to evaluate where the most successful elements of our voter registration program were found. The Voter Registration Tool dramatically improved the efficiency of our voter registration program in the field in 2012, and resulted in significantly more new voter registrations from targeted supporters per shift.
